## What is JavaScript?

- JavaScript is a client-side scripting language used to create dynamic & interactive content on websites.
- It works alongside HTML & CSS to build modern web applications.
- JavaScript is untested, multi-paradigm & event-driven, allowing developers to build interactive user interfaces.
- It is interpreted by the browser’s JavaScript engine, meaning it runs directly in the browser without compilation.

## JavaScript Features

- **Untyped** : Variables don't require a specific data type providing flexibility in usage.
- **Multi-paradigm** : Supports object-oriented, functional & imperative programming styles.
- **Functional** : Functions are first-class citizens, enabling higher-order functions & functional - programming techniques.
- **Event-driven** : JavaScript reacts to user interactions like clicks, keypresses & other events in real time.
- **Interpreted** : JavaScript is interpreted by the browser’s engine enabling immediate execution of the code in the client-side environment.
