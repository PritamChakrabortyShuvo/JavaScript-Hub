## What is Javascript?

- JavaScript is a client-side scripting language used to create dynamic & interactive content on websites.
- It works alongside HTML & CSS to build modern web applications.
- JavaScript is untested, multi-paradigm & event-driven, allowing developers to build interactive user interfaces.
- It is interpreted by the browserâ€™s JavaScript engine, meaning it runs directly in the browser without compilation.
